Options P&L Limit Price Calculator

A simple mobile-friendly tool I built to help with one specific problem that kept showing up during my trading journey:

When trading options, the limit price you set when selling a contract determines your actual P&L — but it’s not always intuitive how that limit price relates to your percentage gain or dollar gain, at least when you are about to sell it.
Most times, I found myself guessing a limit price instead of knowing exactly what price matches a +20%, +50%, or +100% move on my contract.

This tool fixes that.

🎯 What It Does

You enter:
	•	Your entry price for the option (per contract)
	•	Number of contracts (optionally)
	•	A % change slider for how much you want the contract to move
(e.g. +15%, +50%, +120%, etc.)

And it instantly shows:
	•	The new contract limit price
	•	The dollar P&L
	•	The percentage P&L (same as the slider)

This makes it easy to:
	•	Set realistic limit sells
	•	Stop guessing random numbers
	•	Understand exactly what price corresponds to your target percentages
	•	Trade more intentionally instead of emotionally
